required  to purchase a zoom H1n or H1 portable digital recorder
high quality headphones are also a good investment
all software and materials are free

digital recorder needs:
* to record at 44.1 khz/16 bits
* wav/aiff compress file

Software
* Reaper DAW
* Audacity(maybe)
* ORCA live audio programming

Pook
* Power tools for synthesizer programming

Basic acoustics
What is sound and how do we talk about it?
we will learn how to talk to and audio engineer

sounds + (fairly rapid) changes in air pressure
disrupting the molecules around something
like throwing a pebble into a pond

things will sound different in different environments

alternating pressure
pressure vs rarefication

amplitude
related to loudness
how we measure variations in pressure

wave form visual representation of digital audio

frequency and pitch
related but not the same

pitch amplitude loudness

frequency


orchestras tune off of an oboe

different parts of the world consider different frequencies pleasing
music in western  parts  might not sounds nice to some one in india and vise verse

every sound wave can be broken into sine waves

timbre(pronounced tamber) = tone "color"

if a violin is playing the same sound and a another instrument they will sound lightly different

harmonics
sounds are rich and complex
hitting the c note on a piano includes more then the c note on another instrument adds  complexity and uniqueness

signal flow
every step of the audio chain, from the instrument to your ear, is limited by the weakest link

there is not such thinking and true digital audio if we can hear it

transducer = energy converter

microphone is one type
every microphone has a"voice"

every recording medium sounds differently

speakers are a transducer

recording = translation
(or, all recoding is a lie)
nothing sounds the way you think it headphones

the audio chain matters
