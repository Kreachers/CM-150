How do we measure digital quality?

sampling rate
number of measurements per cycle

Bit depth
how accurate or resolution of those measurements are vertically on the graph

44.1khz is 44,100 measurements taken per second

average human hearing range is from 20hz to 20khz

Bit crushing
taking a higher bit audio sample and lowing the bitrate and getting a more gungy sound

clipping
pushing the frequency beyod what can be measured



Formats quality vs size

umcomressed
lossless
aiff
wav


compressed
lossless flac
apple lossless


compressed
lossy
mpw
ogg
aac
wma


bitrate vs bit depth

bit rate is the numner of bits that are conveyed or processed per unit of time
bit rate is measured is bits/s
common mp3
128 kbit/s
192 kbit/s
256 kbit/s
320 kbit/s

cbr vs vbr
constant bit rate vs variable bit rate
cbr is large then vbr

important in digital audio, you can always move from higher quality to lower quality but never move versa. you cant create data that isn't there.

lossy audio doesnt belong in this class
