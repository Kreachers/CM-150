Creating digital audio
cmpm 150

Nathan altice

required  to purchase a zoom H1n or H1 portable digital recorder
high quality headphones are also a good investment
all software and materials are free

digital recorder needs:
* to record at 44.1 khz/16 bits
* wav/aiff compress file

Software
* Reaper DAW
* Audacity(maybe)
* ORCA live audio programming

Pook
* Power tools for synthesizer programming

Basic acoustics
What is sound and how do we talk about it?
we will learn how to talk to and audio engineer

sounds + (faily rapid) changes in air pressire
disrupting the molecus around somethin
like throughing a pebble into a pond

things will sound differenclt in different environments

alternating pressure
pressure vs rarefication

amplitude
related to loudness
how we measure varioations in pressure



wave form visual representation of digital audio

frequency and pitch
related but not the same



pitch amplitude loudness

frequency


orchestras tune off of an obo

different parts of the world consider different frequnecies pleasing
musicin westrn  parts  might not sounds nice to some one in indiaand vise verse

every sound wave can ve broken into sine waves

timbre = tnd = "color"

if a violin is playing the same sound and a another instrument they will sound lightly different  b


harmonics
sounds are rich and complex
hitting the c note on a piano includes more then the c note on another instrument adds  complexity and uniqueness

signal flow
every step of the audio chain, from the instrument to your ear, is limited by the weakest link

there is not such thinking and true digital audio if we can hear it



transducer = energy converter

microphone is one type
every microphone has a"voice"

every recording medium sounds differently

speakers are a transducer

recording = translation
(or, all recoding is a lie)
nothing sounds the way you think it headphones

the audio chain matters
