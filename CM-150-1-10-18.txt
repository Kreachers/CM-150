analog audio
smooth, continuous changed in electrical signal that model variations in air pressure

why is analog good?
most accurate measure of physical reality
infinite granularity, can zoom in as much you want
warmth
direct manipulation(flanging tape reels)
material(can collect touch and hold it)

why is analog bad
noise(electrical interference)
signal loss of generations
no fast searching
bulky,expensive,fragile
analog != physical
digital != physical

digital audio
discrete representation of sounds

why is digital good?
no(or very little) noise
infinite replication
immediate random access
smol
easy to process and manipulate

why is digital bad?
cold, clinical, too perfect
bit rot, hard disk failure
and other forms of data loss
compatibility
no(or little) direct manipulation
the infinite problem(can do too many things so you do nothing)

how do we measure digital audio
sampling rate(horizontal measurement number of amplitude snapshots per seconds)
frequency spectrum(perceived human hearing)
bit depth(vertical resolution of individual ...)
minimum 44.1khz and 16bit audio for human hearing

common digital formats
telephone                8 khz 7-bit
compact disc          44.1 khz 16-bit
dvd                     48 khz 16-bit
high end computer audio 96 khz 24-bit
blu ray audio          192 khz 24-bit
