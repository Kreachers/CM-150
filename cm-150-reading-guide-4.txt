IT'S NOT THE TOOLS
1. In your own words, describe Steve Lacy's recording process.

He plays around with instruments until he gets something he likes. he gets to the studio and setups up his irig and just kinda jams on the guitar till he gets everything he wants.

2. Do you find Lacy's approach interesting? Why or why not?

I quite like it. it looks like he really enjoys doing it the way he wants. presumably the studio he is in has other equipment and instruments he could use but he continues to just use his phone. i never really thought about how he could pull his phone out and just make a beat of jam where ever he wants but i think its clever.

3. What connections to you see between Lacy's process and the Brian Eno article we read?

They both do their own weird way of making music because its how they want to do it. They enjoy it. They both seem to just kinda play with various samples that they either make themselves or cut from something else.

4. What is another widely available technology (in any medium) that allowed artists to work in a new or unexpected way? How did that technology change the medium or allow different types of creators to work in that medium?

video games. for some reason people like making music within video games. for example they will take the gun shot sounds and use those sounds and auto tune them to recreate a song or make a new song. It kind of ridiculous but cool at the same time. I will post a link to an example at the end of this answer.
as technology changes more and different games use different sounds and different quality of audio recordings. so people that create music like this will have a larger list of sounds to use with various qualities.
