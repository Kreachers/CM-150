AIKIN, POWER TOOLS FOR SYNTHESIZER PROGRAMMING, CHAPTER 2

1.Briefly define sound. How is it produced? How is sound different from music?
sound is fairly rapid changes in pressure of a medium, usually air.
Created by moving something creating pressure waves
the difference is a matter of perspective. For some a single note repeated is
  music and isn't for others.

2.What does frequency measure? What is the frequency range of human hearing?
The number of times pressure cycle from high to low or vise verse
20hz to 20khz

3.Define amplitude. How is it different from loudness?
The measurement of how much sound, how large the sound wave is.
loudness is a combination of frequency and amplitude. If the sound wave is out
  of the human hearing range then it cant really be loud.

4.What is a transducer? Give three examples.
transforms energy from one type to another.
electric motor: electric to rotational
speaker: electric to air pressure
microphone: air pressure to electric

5.Describe the differences between sampling rate and bit resolution.
Sampling: How many times a measurement of sound is taken per second.
Bit resolution: How accurately the sound wave represents the original sound.

6.Do you have any prior experience with sound? If so, what? What would you like
  to learn about sound?
I have about 22 years of experience with sound. I listen to it every day of my
  life. I would find it hard to live without.
